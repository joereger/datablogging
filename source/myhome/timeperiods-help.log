Remember, we're is dedicated to long-term nostalgia capture, organization and presentation.

Or you can just surf the site a bit and you'll certainly see the little timeline at the bottom of entries.");

mb.append("<br><br>There is the ability to have private Time Periods. Only you or those you give permission to can see them.");

mb.append("<br><br>Users can also define some periods as open ended. This means that they don't have an actual end date... the automatically inherit the current date/time. This makes sense, for example, for a time period like “Living in Atlanta.”  Since you’re still living in Atlanta you don’t want to have to update the end date every day to keep it accurate.  You can simply leave it open ended until you move to Colorado.");
