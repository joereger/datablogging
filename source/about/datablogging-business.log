mb.append("<li>Community - People are able to connect with each other based on their data.  For example, runners in Seattle who run more than 35 miles a week at a pace greater than 7mph can find each other.</li>");

mb.append("<li>Brand Expansion - As their running bloggers share their runs with their friends and family, the running magazine's brand is visible, giving it much exposure.</li>");

mb.append("It's very Web 1.0 to say this, but you've got eyeballs!

Maybe you tried chat rooms... or forums... or email newsletters.  You've had some success, but it's been tough... adoption rates aren't what you expected.");

mb.append("<b>Blogs work where other community-building technologies fail:</b>");
mb.append("<ul>");
mb.append("<li>Bulletin boards, chat rooms and wikis all have a critical mass problem.  Without a certain number of users these technologies look empty and actually repel users.  Blogs, on the other hand, are self-contained from a user perspective... they can create their blog and find value in it even if there are no other users on the system yet.</li>");
mb.append("<li>Blogs are ego-based content creation mechanisms.  People who use them are creating an extension of themselves.  This means that they're more likely to continue to invest in it after they create their account, unlike, say, a bulletin board.</li>");

mb.append("<b>What's the benefit?</b>");
mb.append("<ul>");
mb.append("<li>Revenue - There are many ways to monetize a blog offering.  Banner ads.  User upgrades to Pro features.  Email newsletter sponsorships.  We'll work with you to find the best plan of attack.</li>");
mb.append("<li>Brand extension - Imagine having 1,000,000 blogs powered by your company.  All of them have your company logo at the top/side.  Every time one of your 1,000,000 bloggers shares a picture with their family they expose your brand.</li>");
mb.append("<li>Internet footprint - Each blog entry your users creates has a link back to your site.  To search engines your site looks massive... a big funnel pointing traffic back to your primary media asset.</li>");
mb.append("<li>Loyalty - Users are using your service to extend themselves.  In effect you're giving them the microphone.  You're showing them that you trust them.</li>");
mb.append("<li>Media Interplay - More and more, different media types are working together to tell a richer story. Adding user-generated content is a critical step in this process.  Traditional media leads to user generated media which stimulates further traditional media... just ask Dan Rather... he knows.</li>");
mb.append("</ul>");
mb.append("<b>Why Reger.com's datablogging over a traditional blog technology?</b>");
mb.append("<ul>");
mb.append("<li>Better Offering - To attract users away from the big public blog services you need something special.  Charts and graphs show your users that you've got something unique.</li>");
mb.append("<li>Fit Interests of Your Market - You can create custom log types that fit your market.  For example, a running magazine can create a custom running log.  A consumer magazine can create a log type for product reviews that matches the format of reviews they do in print.</li>");
