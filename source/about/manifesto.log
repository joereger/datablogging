We need a repository... a 360 degree view of our mental, physical and emotional state at any given point in history.  This repository will not supplant our memories.  It will complement them, sparking nostalgia and speeding our acquisition of wisdom.");

mb.append("With current technology we must admit that capturing, storing, indexing and manipulating our lives is a hassle at best.  With no standardization, rhyme or reason most of us end up with disparate piles of imagery, video and writing.  A scrap book in the basement.  A diary under the bed.");

mb.append("Take artificial intelligence and fuzzy logic as an example.  These technologies have been applied to commerce websites with great results.  One site in particular had its artificial intelligence rip through gigabytes of sales data and quickly learned through its algorithms that people who bought a certain Mozart CD also liked The Cure.  This would be almost impossible for any human to recognize because it is so hidden in the data.  The power of technology is that it can find hundreds of such data correlations in our personal lives.
