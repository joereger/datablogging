		<description type="text/html" escaped="true">Soulive is one of the great jam bands.  They&#8217;re almost impossible to capture well on CD, but this disc comes the closest.  I don&#8217;t really know what to call it: acid jazz, or just jazz, or trip-jazz, or something.  It&#8217;s basically just a really good flow.
And there&#8217;s no singing (except for some guest vocals on a couple of tracks).  Not necessarily good or bad, just different.  I probably would have given this disc 5 / 5, but part of the reason for the post is showing off the &#8220;stars&#8221;, and I wanted to demonstrate an empty one too.</description>
