For example, a user could create a gate guard log, a mission log or a training log.  Each log has custom data fields:  dropdowns, numeric fields, text fields, etc.  Ad-hoc graphs can be created and saved by users based on their own custom data fields.  RSS feeds include their custom data.  APIs include their data.  in essence, the system is a combination of blogs, databases and data mining.  We also include a number of social networking features.");

We were involved in a research bid for DARPA's LifeLog project, before that project was shut down for funding and political reasons.  The goal of the research we proposed was to annotate and extract wisdom from many rich and different data streams.  Generals and unit commanders both need the ability to better organize small bits of information to gain a high level perspective. We'd be glad to share that proposal with you, upon your request.");
