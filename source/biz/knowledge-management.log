mb.append("<h1>There are three likely reasons for this:</h1>");
mb.append("<ol>");
mb.append("<li>The information they are looking for is scattered across multiple systems or stored in information silos.  It is therefore not accessible. ");
mb.append("<li>The information is available but the search tool/KM system they are using is either not easy enough for the average user to use -- or -- is not able to provide high quality results due to a lack of contextual information. ");
mb.append("<li>The information is not digital and therefore is not available.  Lot of information and knowledge falls below the \"document\" threshold and is therefore not available in published form. ");
mb.append("</ol>");

mb.append("<br>");
mb.append("<h1>Knowledge Management Blogs provide a cost-effective solution to this problem by breaking down information silos in two ways:</h1>");
mb.append("<ol>");
mb.append("<li>First, by allowing individuals to post information locked in desktop information silos.  For example:  e-mail systems (e-mail to weblog), desktop document stores (post document to weblog), desktop multimedia (post file to weblog), bookmark lists (post link to weblog), and pictures (post picture to weblog).");
mb.append("<li>Second, knowledge management blogs can also absorb and post data drawn from external resources such as Web applications and RSS newsfeeds (both traditional and from applications). ");
mb.append("</ol>");

mb.append("<br>");
mb.append("<h1>Knowledge Management Blogs simplify finding information.</h1>");
mb.append("<ul>");
mb.append("<li>All information posted to blogs is made to the Intranet where they can be easily searched by standard search engines.  Additional data such as Google's Pagerank and other filtering mechanisms that leverage the combined wisdom of employees publishing to their blogs, make it easy to find relevant information. ");
mb.append("<li>Finally, the presence of employee blogs increases the chance that experts will emerge.  These experts, via their blog, provide a ready reference of information and insight related to their area of focus (and if all else fails, a person that can be quickly contacted for an answer -- blogs are your internal business card). ");
mb.append("</ul>");

mb.append("<br>");
mb.append("<h1>Blogs radically increase the possibility that meaningful information and knowledge will be captured and archived on the Intranet. </h1>");
mb.append("<ul>");
mb.append("<li>There isn't another system that even comes close.  Blogs provide employees with a system that is easy to use (virtually zero training), immediate benefits, and enhanced personal prestige/value. ");
mb.append("<li>Blogs can be used continuously on an ad hoc or project by project basis, as a result they are very flexible and horizontal in their utilization (increases the potential that they will be used). ");
mb.append("<li>Posts to a blog are of indeterminate length and composition.  They can be as long as a research paper or as short as a single line of text with a link (this makes it possible to capture knowledge and information below the document threshold).");
