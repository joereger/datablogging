We strongly feel that while blogs have already shown value, they have not shown all they're capable of.  In many cases candidates still edited content for their blogs through public relations experts.  This editing has a general effect of sanitizing the communications. Blogs work because they are raw.  They prove that the author, in your case a candidate, is a person.  People identify with other people who share common interests, faults and beliefs.  By full embracing a blog program that includes open, unedited content straight from the candidate's keyboard, we are convinced that they can have more impact.  Please allow us to convince you to take the jump of faith.");
