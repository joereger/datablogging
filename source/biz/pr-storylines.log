mb.append("Increasingly people are collecting vast amounts of personal data.  But it's not being organized.  It's being stored in disconnected media... video tapes here... CD's there... hard drives... printed photos... email folders.  It's impossible to draw a sense of nostalgia from disconnected data.  That's where we come in.  Our tools allow individuals to create a personal information repository that collects, organizes and analyzes personal data.  The building blocks have been around for years in big business... data warehouses, OLAP engines and charting libraries.  But they've never been applied to personal data. What are the risks of increased personal data without a personal information repository?  How are privacy concerns met as more and more personal information is stored in the personal information repository?");
