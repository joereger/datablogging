The best are built bottom-up by engaged individuals cooperating to construct something far more valuable: an intranetworked corporate conversation. While this scares companies witless, they also depend heavily on open intranets to generate and share critical knowledge. They need to resist the urge to \"improve\" or control these networked conversations.   When corporate intranets are not constrained by fear and legalistic rules, the type of conversation they encourage sounds remarkably like the conversation of the networked marketplace.\"");

From tech companies like Microsoft (which says it \"respects and supports\" blogs like Scoble's) and IBM to decidedly nontech outfits like Dr. Pepper, companies are starting to use blogging both as a medium to market products and monitor brands and as an internal knowledge-management tool.  Corporate America is jumping onto the blogwagon for many of the same reasons all those journalists, brooding teenagers, and presidential campaigners are already on board. Unlike email and instant messaging, blogs let employees post comments that can be seen by many and mined for information at a later date, and internal blogs aren't overwhelmed by spam. And unlike most corporate intranets, they're a bottoms-up approach to communication. \"With blogs, you gain more, you hear more, you understand where things are going more,\" says Halley Suitt, who wrote a fictional case study on corporations and blogging for the Harvard Business Review . \"Even better, you understand them faster.\"\"");
