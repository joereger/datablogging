
Hibernate was once used as part of the app.  The jar files were removed
to save space in the build, but the hard work of configuring
it was kept.  Here's how to re-enable Hibernate.

1) Obtain all of the Hibernate jars and put them into the /WEB-INF/lib directory:
    - cglib-2.1.jar
    - dom4j-1.5.2.jar
    - commons-logging.jar
    - commons-logging-api.jar
    - hibernate3.jar
    - ehcache-1.1.jar
    - asm.jar
    - asm-attrs.jar
    - asm-util.jar
    - cgilib-nodep-2.1.jar

2)Add the following to web.xml
<servlet>
  <servlet-name>HibernateUtil</servlet-name>
  <servlet-class>reger.entities.HibernateUtil</servlet-class>
  <load-on-startup>100</load-on-startup>
</servlet>

3) Uncomment the reger.entities.HibernateUtil class.
