
GETTING THE APP TO RUN ON JBOSS APPLICATION SERVER

------------------------

Some information (as of this document's creation) at:
http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=ConfiguringMultipleJBossInstancesOnOneMachine

------------------------

If you have multiple IP Addresses:
Launch each instance of JBoss AS with the commandline option to bind this instance
to a particular IP address (run.bat -b <ip-addressORhost> -c all)
where all is your configuration... could be all, default, etc.

This is generally done in production.

------------------------

If you want to run multiple instances on one IP address:

1) Download the jboss application server as interactive installer.
   Install the "all" configuration when prompted.

2) Extract jboss to c:/superfly/jboss/

3) Rename jboss/server/all/deploy/jbossweb-tomcat55.sar/ROOT.war/ directory to oldROOT.war/

3) If you want jboss to run multiple versions of the app on the same server:
   a) Make sure you have C:\Superfly\jboss\server\all\ to copy... if you don't
      then you installed a version without the full version support of jboss.
      You can use these same instructions with jboss\server\default\ but you won't
      have clustering support, should you decide to use it later on.

   b) Copy C:\Superfly\jboss\server\all\ to C:\Superfly\jboss\server\allInstance1
   c) Copy C:\Superfly\jboss\server\all\ to C:\Superfly\jboss\server\allInstance2

   d) Edit C:\Superfly\jboss\server\allInstance1\deploy\binding-service.xml
        i) Uncomment the <mbean code="org.jboss.services.binding.ServiceBindingManager" node
        ii) Set <attribute name="ServerName">ports-01</attribute>
   e) Edit C:\Superfly\jboss\server\allInstance2\deploy\binding-service.xml
        i) Uncomment the <mbean code="org.jboss.services.binding.ServiceBindingManager" node
        ii) Set <attribute name="ServerName">ports-02</attribute>

   f) Edit C:\Superfly\jboss\server\allInstance1\deploy\cluster-service.xml
        i) Set loopback="true" in the UDP node
   g) Edit C:\Superfly\jboss\server\allInstance2\deploy\cluster-service.xml
        i) Set loopback="true" in the UDP node

   h) Edit C:\Superfly\jboss\server\allInstance1\deploy\tc5-cluster-service.xml
        i) Set loopback="true" in the UDP node
   i) Edit C:\Superfly\jboss\server\allInstance2\deploy\tc5-cluster-service.xml
        i) Set loopback="true" in the UDP node

   j) Make sure you have a farm-service.xml file in:
      C:\Superfly\jboss\server\allInstance1\deploy\
      C:\Superfly\jboss\server\allInstance2\deploy\
      (If your install didn't automatically create this file,
      download the zip file of jboss, extract it and find it
      in \jboss\server\all\deploy\deploy.last\farm-service.xml.
      The main thing you're looking for is that this version of
      farm-service.xml uses this syntax: ${jboss.partition.name:DefaultPartition}
      so that it'll pull the cluster/partition name from the
      command line on startup.  Older versions of this file don't do that.)

   k) If you need to set individual port numbers for each instance, edit:
      /jboss/docs/examples/binding-manager/sample-bindings.xml

4) Start a particular instance by running the following in /bin/:
   run.bat -c allInstance1 -g allInstance1 -u 230.1.2.7
   run.bat -c allInstance2 -g allInstance2 -u 230.1.2.8

------------------------

The default port settings in sample-bindings.xml have:
ports-01 = http on port 8180
ports-02 = http on port 8280
ports-03 = http on port 8380

------------------------

You can view the current cluster information by pointing your browser to the JMX console
of any JBoss instance in the cluster (i.e., http://hostname:8080/jmx-console/) and then
clicking on the jboss:service=DefaultPartition MBean (change the MBean name to reflect your
cluster name if this node does not join DefaultPartition). A list of IP addresses for the
current cluster members is shown in the CurrentView field.
