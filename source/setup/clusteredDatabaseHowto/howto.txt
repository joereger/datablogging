
These are instructions for setting up database clustering to improve performance of the system.
This is an advanced operation and is not recommended for most installations.   It is only required
as you increase traffic and need to overcome a database performance bottleneck.

Clustering the database involves setting up Sequoia as a controller.  Think of this software as combining
many MySql databases into a single load-balanced virtual database.

Sequoia is a java app and to run it as a service you need to use Java Service Wrapper:
http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/doc/english/introduction.html

Download both sequoia and the java service wrapper.  We're going to put a few files from java service wrapper into
sequoia and run it there.  An example of this process can be found here:

INSTALL THE CONTROLLER AS A SERVICE
======================
1) Copy these four files to the sequoia /bin/ directory
{WRAPPER_HOME}\bin\Wrapper.exe
{WRAPPER_HOME}\src\bin\App.bat.in
{WRAPPER_HOME}\src\bin\InstallApp-NT.bat.in
{WRAPPER_HOME}\src\bin\UninstallApp-NT.bat.in

2) Rename from *.bat.in to *.bat

3) Copy these two files to sequoia /lib/
{WRAPPER_HOME}\lib\Wrapper.DLL
{WRAPPER_HOME}\lib\wrapper.jar

4) Create a sequoia /conf/ directory

5) Create a sequoia /logs/ directory

6) Put the wrapper.conf file included in this reger.com package (in this /setup/ directory) in the sequoia /conf/ directory

7) In wrapper.conf, make sure this line is pointing to the valid database driver:
wrapper.java.classpath.33=%SEQUOIA_HOME%\drivers\mysql-connector-java-3.1.8-bin.jar

8) Set the system environment variable SEQUOIA_HOME to the sequoia home directory

9) Move controller-raidb1-reger.com to sequoia /config/controller/

10) Copy the RAIDb1-mysql-cluster-reger.xml file from this directory to the sequoia /config/virtualdatabase/ directory.

11) Customize the DatabaseBackend elements.  Each one of these elements configures a connection to a single MySql database.

12) Customize recovery log elements

13) Create a database called regersequoiabackup and make sure that the recovery log element points to it.

14) Move mysql-connector-java-3.1.8-bin.jar to sequoia /drivers/

15) Run App.bat to verify that the controller can run

16) You can now install the controller as a service with InstallApp-NT.bat

CONFIGURE THE APP TO USE THE CONTROLLER AS A DATABASE
=====================
1) Change the jdbc driver name to use sequoia's driver and point it to the controller. Do this in the application
on the /LOE tab in the System Settings/Database Setup screen.
dbDriverName=org.continuent.sequoia.driver.Driver
dbConnectionUrl=jdbc:sequoia://localhost/reger

or, if you edit the config file manually (not recommended):
dbDriverName=org.continuent.sequoia.driver.Driver
dbConnectionUrl=jdbc\:sequoia\://localhost/reger

ADDING A NEW BACKEND
======================
1) Make sure Sequoia knows about the database by adding a backend node to RAIDb1-mysql-cluster-reger.xml

2) Start sequoia_home/bin/console.bat

3) admin reger

4) You'll be prompted for username and password...  enter values in xml file configuring sequoia, admin:XXXXX

5) backup reger1 dumpname Octopus c:/superfly/sequoia-db-dumps/

6) You'll be prompted for username and password... enter the values of the u/p stored on the database itself, not xml file

7) disable reger2

8) restore backend reger2 dumpname

9) enable reger2
